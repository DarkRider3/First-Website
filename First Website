        DIfference Between Div and Span
    </header>
    <pre>Div and span are two Elements with two very different functions.
       <u>Div</u>:- It is a Block-level Element, which means that it always starts in a new line, it always takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can) and it has a top and a bottom margin, whereas an inline element does not. The div element is often used as a container for other HTML elements.
       <u>Span</u>:- It is a Inline Element, which means that it does not start on a new line and it only takes up as much width as necessary. The span element is an inline container used to mark up a part of a text, or a part of a document.</pre>
